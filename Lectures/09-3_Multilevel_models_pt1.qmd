## Goals for multilevel models

*Very Important*:

- Understand the nature of the problems we are trying to solve
- Understand the value in solving them

*Moderately Important*:

- Understand some of the technical aspects of multilevel model fitting and interpretation

*Minimally Important*:

- Understand the math involved


## Assumptions of linear regression

1. Normality (check pooled residuals)
1. Homogeneity (check pooled residuals, transformation?)
1. Fixed explanatory variables (plan sampling)
1. Independence (observations often correlated)
1. Correct model


## Non-independence: The main challenge

Our tests (so far) assume independence of samples.

Lots of data have structure at additional levels beyond the main variable(s) of interest

- Error in these levels is correlated (making the data non-independent)

We need a method to model that correlation structure.


## *Explicitly* correlated data

By design:

- Grouping 
    - Leaves within plants within treatments within fields
    - Treatments within plots within blocks 
- Repeated measurements of the same individual (time or space)


## *Implicitly* correlated data

As a side effect:

- Non-equal sample sizes, missing data
- Non-equal within-group variance
- Phylogenetic structure 
- Population structure and genetic relatedness 


## Some terminology

*Multilevel / hierarchical / mixed / repeated measures models*

- All refer to the same class of models, which contain both fixed and random variables.
- Some will further subdivide and draw fine distinctions between models.


## Some terminology

*Fixed effects*:

- Explanatory variables of primary interest, which would be used again if the experiment were repeated
- Sex, treatment groups, etc.


## Some terminology

*Random effects*

- Variables that are a "random" selection from a larger set of variables that allow for heterogeneity, correlation, phylogenetic or genetic structure, real random variation ($\epsilon$).
- Subject, block, etc.
- "Random" does not necessarily mean "not of interest."

## Fundamental idea of multilevel models

Units are *grouped* at different levels.

- Grouping takes different forms


## General multilevel model formula

$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + ... + \beta_n X_n + \mbox{Random}$$

Where $\mbox{Random}$ can be:

- Random noise ($\epsilon$)
- Heterogeneity of variance
- Nesting structure
- Temporal correlation (autocorrelation)
- Spatial correlation
- Phylogenetic correlation
- Genetic correlation

## Hierarchical structure

- Maneuver (hover vs. clockwise, hover vs. counterclockwise)
    - Bird (4)
        - Trial (5)
            - Wingbeat (mean of 16 $\rightarrow$ 1)

1. Maneuver is the variable of interest ("fixed")
1. Birds are a representative sample of all birds ("random")
1. Trials are repeated measures of each bird ("random")
1. Wingbeats are the observation level


## What we did

1. Calculate means of 16 wingbeats for each bird for each trial
    - Loss of information, but...
1. Five trials per bird
1. Multilevel ANOVA
    - Bird and trial nested within bird as random effects
    - Maneuver as the fixed effect

Each bird gets its own mean value for a maneuver (across 5 trials). Maneuver is analyzed as the mean difference between each maneuver.


## Challenges to multilevel models

**Conceptual complexity**

- You must know your model
- Difficult to visualize
- Do my results make sense?

**Computational complexity**

- Many methods fit by likelihood
- MCMC can be slow, difficult to tune
- Bayesian requires defining priors
