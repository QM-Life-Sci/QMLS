## Comparison of two means

- One categorical predictor (factor) with two levels
    - Internally re-coded as 0 and 1
- One level is the *reference* level
    - Default is alphabetically first factor
    - Be careful with factors coded with integers

> "How much does the outcome variable change (positive or negative) for each 1 unit increase in the predictor?"

## Are longer horns protective against predation?

::: {.incremental}

- Is mean horn length in live horned lizards *different* than in dead horned lizards?
    - Is the mean horn length larger?
- How does natural variation in horn length impact the observed mean value?
    - What difference(s) do we expect from random sampling of horned lizards?

## Horned lizard predation

Simulate data with ~10% difference in horn length:

- Alive: n = 150, mean horn length = 24.5 mm, sd = 2.6
- Dead: n = 30, mean horn length = 22.0 mm, sd = 2.7

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide

set.seed(3575575)

Alive <- rnorm(n = 150, mean = 24.5, sd = 2.6)
Dead <- rnorm(n = 30, mean = 22.0, sd = 2.7)
Group <- c(rep("Alive", 150),
           rep("Dead", 30))

HL <- tibble(Horn_Length = c(Alive, Dead),
             Group = factor(Group))
HL
```


## Horned lizard predation

```{r}
HL |> 
  ggplot(aes(Horn_Length)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "gray50") +
  facet_grid(Group ~ .) +
  labs(x = "Horn Length (mm)", y = "Count")
```


## Summarize

```{r}
#| echo: true

HL |>
  summarize(Horn_mean = mean(Horn_Length),
            Horn_sd = sd(Horn_Length),
            n = length(Horn_Length),
            .by = Group)
```


## How does the mean change in alive lizards compared to dead?

```{r}

HL$CatNum <- as.numeric(HL$Group) - 1
HL$CatJitter <- HL$CatNum + rnorm(nrow(HL), 0, 0.1)

## Minimize sums of squares

```{r}

HL$pred <- NA
mu.a <- mean(HL$Horn_Length[HL$Group == "Alive"])
mu.d <- mean(HL$Horn_Length[HL$Group == "Dead"])
HL$pred[HL$Group == "Alive"] <- mu.a
HL$pred[HL$Group == "Dead"] <- mu.d

```


## A linear model {.smaller}

```{r}
#| echo: true

mod <- lm(Horn_Length ~ Group, data = HL)

summary(mod)

```

Horn length in live horned lizards: `r round(mean(HL$Horn_Length[HL$Group == "Alive"]), 4)` mm

Horn length in dead horned lizards: `r round(mean(HL$Horn_Length[HL$Group == "Dead"]), 4)` mm


## How does the mean change in alive lizards compared to dead?


Horn length in live horned lizards: `r round(mean(HL$Horn_Length[HL$Group == "Alive"]), 1)` mm

Horn length in dead horned lizards: `r round(mean(HL$Horn_Length[HL$Group == "Dead"]), 1)` mm

Imagine you collected 100 live horned lizards and randomly assigned 50 to each of two groups.

- Do you think they would have the same mean horn length?
- How different do you think the means would be?
- Think about how the variability among individual horn length measurements would affect your intuition here.

## Bayesian framework


## Bayes model

```{r}
#| echo: true

model <- "
  data{
    int N;
    array[N] real Horn_Length;
    array[N] int Group12;
  }
  parameters{
    vector[2] b;
    real<lower=0> sigma;
  }
  model{
    // Priors
    b ~ normal(20, 10);
    sigma ~ normal(0, 4);
    
    // Model
    Horn_Length ~ normal(b[Group12], sigma);
  }
"
```


## Sample the model...

```{r}
#| label: stan_fit
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| results: hide

if (FALSE) {
  # Only run this interactively to avoid needing to refit the model
  # each time you render the slides. Posterior samples are saved out
  # to a qs file to save space. Only saving mu and sigma without
  # any diagnostics, etc.

mcmc_trace(post)
```


## Summarizing the results

1. `b[1]` = Alive horn length
1. `b[2]` = Dead horn length
1. `sigma` = Standard deviation of the mean

```{r}
#| fig-height: 3

samples <- post |>

  mutate(Difference = `b[1]` - `b[2]`)

mcmc_dens(samples,
          pars = c("b[1]", "b[2]", "sigma"))

```


## Posterior Difference

```{r}
QQ <- quantile(samples$Difference, probs = c(0.025, 0.5, 0.975)) |> 
  as.numeric()
```

- Median: `r round(QQ[2], 2)`
- 95% Highest-density interval: `r round(QQ[1], 2)` -- `r round(QQ[3], 2)`

```{r}
#| fig-height: 4

ggplot(samples, aes(Difference)) +
  geom_density(fill = "firebrick4", alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = QQ[2]) +
