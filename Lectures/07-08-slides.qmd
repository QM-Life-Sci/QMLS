## Non-linear models

- Does $e^x$ appear as one of the predictors? (e.g., growth)
- Are there ratios of predictors? (e.g., enzyme kinetics)

```{r}
set.seed(238746)
DD <- tibble(Age = seq(0, 20, length.out = 25),
             Length = 30 + 140 / (1 + exp(-0.65 * (Age - 10)))) |> 
  mutate(Length = Length + rnorm(n(), 0, 2))
ggplot(DD, aes(Age, Length)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 170, color = "darkred", linewidth = 1) +
  geom_point() +
  annotate(
    geom = "text",
    x = 5, y = 150,
    label = TeX("$Length(Age) = \\frac{Length_{final}}{1 + e^{-b~(Age - c)}}$",
                output = "character"),
    parse = TRUE,
    size = 7)
```
