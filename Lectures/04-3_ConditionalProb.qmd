## Conditional probability

Probabilities of many events change given the presence (success) of some other event

::: {.incremental}

- If it is raining the probability that I will carry an umbrella is 100%
    - If it is not, the probability is 5%
- If it is January, the probability of snow is 20%
    - If it is May, the probability of snow is <1%
- If the soil temperature is above 24C, corn germination rate is 75%
    - If the soil temperature is below 24C, the rate is 30%

## Conditional probability {.nostretch}

The **conditional probability** of a dependent event is the probability of that event occurring given that another condition or conditions is met.

## Conditional probability 

$$Pr[A|B] \times Pr[B] = Pr[B|A] \times Pr[A]$$

The probability of A given B times the probability of B equals the probability of B given A times the probability of A.

. . .

\begin{align*}
Pr[P|M] \times Pr[M] &= Pr[M|P] \times Pr[P]\\
\frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.04} \times 0.22 &= 0.90 \times 0.20\\
0.18 &= 0.18
\end{align*}


## Bayes' Rule {.smaller}

> "All decisions should be based on evidence, but the best decisions should also be based on previous experience." Stone (2012)

$$Pr[A|B] = \frac{Pr[B|A] \times Pr[A]}{Pr[B]}$$

The conditional probability of $A$ given $B$ relies not only on the probability of $A$, but also of $B$ and of $B$ given $A$.

- Predicting events given prior knowledge of the probability of those events.
- The human brain (usually) works this way in predicting events.


## Bayes' Rule {.nostretch}

Suppose that you wake up one day with spots all over your face. The doctor tells you that 90% of people who have smallpox and 80% of people with chickenpox have these symptoms.

## Bayes' Rule {.nostretch}

You collect a male wasp larva. What is the probability that it was laid in a parisitized host?

$$Pr[M|P] = \frac{\mathbf{Pr[P|M]} \times Pr[M]}{Pr[P]}$$

![](../images/Probability_Conditional.drawio.png){fig-align="center" width="50%"}


## Bayes' Rule

\begin{align*}
Pr[M|P] &= \frac{\mathbf{Pr[P|M]} \times Pr[M]}{Pr[P]}\\
0.9 &= \frac{\mathbf{Pr[P|M]} \times (0.18 + 0.04)}{0.2}\\
\frac{0.18}{0.22} &= \mathbf{Pr[P|M]}\\
0.82 &= \mathbf{Pr[P|M]}
\end{align*}

There is an 82% chance that the egg was laid in a parisitized host.


## Bayes' Rule

Choose a random person off the street and test them for HIV. The test is positive. What is the probability that they actually are HIV+?

1. 95-100%
2. 90-94%
3. 80-89%
4. 65-79%
5. <65%


## HIV Testing

If a person is HIV+, the probability that the test is positive is 99.9% (sensitivity)

  - $Pr[T|H] = 0.999$

If a person *does not have* HIV, the probability that the test is negative is 99.99% (specificity)

  - $Pr[T'|H'] = 0.9999$

Only about 13/100000 people are positive for HIV.

  - $P[H] = 13/100000 = 1.3 \times 10^{-4}$


## Solving with natural numbers {.smaller}

For 100,000 hypothetical people:

- 13 have HIV
- 100000 â€“ 13 = 99987 do not

Of the 13 with HIV:

- 13 * 0.999 = 12.987 test positive
- 13 * 0.001 = 0.013 do not

Of the 99987 who do not:

- 99987 * .0001 = 9.9987 test positive
- 99987 * .9999 = 99977.0013 do not


## Solving with natural numbers

So if:

$Pr(H|T) = \frac{Pr(T|H) \times Pr(H)}{Pr(T)}$

Then:

$Pr(H|T) = \frac{0.999 \times (13/100000)}{(12.987 + 9.9987) / 100000} = 0.565$

Or just $12.987 / (12.987 + 9.9987)$ which is the number of true positives over the total positives.


## Solving with probabilities

$$Pr[H|T] = \frac{Pr[T|H] \times Pr[H]}{Pr[T]}$$

- Find $P[H|T]$

$Pr[T]$ is the challenge.

- Independent probabilities of positive test given HIV and positive test given *not* HIV

$$\left(Pr[T|H] \times P[H]\right) + \left(Pr[T'|H'] \times 1 - P[H]\right)$$


## Solving with probabilities {.smaller}


\begin{align*}
Pr[H|T] &= \frac{Pr[T|H] \times Pr[H]}{Pr[T]} \\
&= \frac{Pr[T|H] \times Pr[H]}{\left(Pr[T|H] \times P[H]\right) + \left(Pr[T'|H'] \times 1 - P[H]\right)} \\
&= \frac{0.999 \times 0.00013}{\left(0.999 \times 0.00013\right) + \left((1 - 0.9999) \times (1 - 0.00013)\right)}
\end{align*}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
((0.999) * 1.3e-4) /
  ((0.999 * 1.3e-4) + ((1 - 0.9999) * (1 - 1.3e-4)))
```
