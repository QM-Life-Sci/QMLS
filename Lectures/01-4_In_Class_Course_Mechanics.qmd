## About us


## About you

- Your preferred name
- Your pronouns
- Your home department and home lab
- Your research area


## What you need

- Laptop
- Can do attitude


## Book, etc.

There is no one-size-fits-all statistics textbook.

- Any that we chose would be a compromise.
- Lots of free material online.
- Many recommendations on Canvas if you are looking for a book.


## Online lectures

- Available Mondays (or sooner)
- Watch, pause, take notes, re-watch, look up topics you don't understand, etc.


## Grading

Participation: Your participation grade in the course will be a function of:

- Quiz questions (completion)
- Problem sets (completion)
- Peer evaluations (both your own completion of and others' evaluations of you)
- In class contributions

Don't worry about what numbers are in the gradebook.


## Grading

Progress Checks:

- Each 4 week block will end with a Progress Check.
    - No new material that week
    - Class time used to answer questions
    - Like a problem set
- You may not work with other members of the class or anyone else on this assignment
- You should use all other available resources (books, notes, lectures, internet, etc.).


## Quiz questions

- In between most of the lectures
    - e.g., Watch a lecture, answer some questions
- Not graded, but you *do* need to complete them.
    - Thoughtful reflection about any you get incorrect


## Problem sets

- Practical experience
- Gradually less guidance
- Experience solving challenges as a team
- All members of the group should participate
- Each group member should submit the same set of answers


## Groups


## Working together

- Many possible successful strategies
    - Remember you have access to lecture code, the google, etc.
- One unsuccessful strategy
    - Splitting up the problem set & not learning all the parts
    - You should only leave class early if your entire group has turned in the problem set

## Peer evaluations


## Reviewing your work

- Problem sets not graded
- You are responsible for checking your group's answers against the answer key


## Typical weekly schedule

*Monday*: Lectures, "quizzes", readings (when applicable) posted online to Canvas

*Thursday*: Assignments due at midnight:

- Previous week's problem set submitted through Canvas
