## Remember the Goal of Statistics

> "a way of taming **uncertainty**, of turning raw **data** into arguments that can resolve profound questions" [@Amabile1989-pf]

- The statistical analyses that you carry out are *models*.
- Inference depends on evaluating the relative support for different models.


## Example: Wing Dimorphic Crickets

> Do long-winged crickets have a higher resting metabolic rate than short-winged crickets?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
Controlling for body mass,

- Metabolic rates do not differ
- Average metabolic rate of long-wings is higher
- Average  metabolic rate of long-wings is lower

## Example: Genetics of Corn Oil Content

> Which set of loci best predicts oil content in corn kernels?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](https://i.imgur.com/w6z5m2e.jpg){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Heritability of corn oil content is 0
- Different possible combinations of SNPs
- All additive
- Dominance
- Epistasis
- Structural variants

## Example: Species richness in Missouri lakes

> Does the number of phytoplankton species change with agricultural intensity around lakes?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](https://i.imgur.com/GoOM9bb.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
- There is no relationship between species richness and agricultural intensity
- There is a positive relationship
- There is a negative relationship

## Example: Canid relationships

> What are the phylogenetic relationships between dog breeds & other canids?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
![](https://i.imgur.com/spdaSkP.jpg){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
- Star phylogeny
- Single origin of dogs
- Ancient breeds are monophyletic
- Every possible tree....

## Example: Predict the species of a fossil

> Is this bone more like a chimpanzee, australopith, Neandertal, or modern human?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](https://i.imgur.com/cQ1Kl1v.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
- What is the percent correct classification of known fossils?
- What are the relative probabilities of new fossil being in one of four taxonomic groups?

## Example: Alligator growth

> Do alligators exhibit determinate or indeterminate growth?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](https://i.imgur.com/scZSjNE.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Determinate:

$Length\left(Age\right) = \frac{\theta_1}{1 + \exp((\theta_2 - Age) / \theta_3)}$

Indeterminate:

$Length\left(Age\right) = \theta_1 + \theta_2 Age + \theta_3 Age^2$
