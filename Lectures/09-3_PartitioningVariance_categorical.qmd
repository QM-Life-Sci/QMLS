## "Analysis of Variance"

Some total variability in $y$:

1. Part explained by group membership
1. Part remains unexplained ("error" or "residual")

$F$-statistic is the ratio of the two.


## Visualizing ANOVA

![](https://i.imgur.com/dNF4ph0.png){fig-align="center"}

$$F = \frac{\mbox{Between Group Variation}}{\mbox{Within Group Variation}}$$


## Parts of an ANOVA table

```{r}
#| echo: true
JL <- read_csv("../data/JetLag.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) |> 
  mutate(Treatment = factor(Treatment))
fm_lm <- lm(Shift ~ Treatment, data = JL)

anova(fm_lm)
```


## How much variation is explained by group membership: $R^{2}$?

```{r}
anova(fm_lm)
```

- `Sum Sq`: Variability accounted for by that part of the ANOVA
- `Mean Sq`: `Sum Sq` / `Df`
- `F value`: `Mean Sq` Treatment / `Mean Sq` Residual
- `Pr(>F)`: *P*-value for the *F*-test of that variable


## How much variation is explained by group membership: $R^{2}$?

$$R^{2} = \frac{\mbox{Variation accounted for by group membership}}{\mbox{Total variation}}$$
<br />

$$R^{2} = \frac{\mbox{Sum Sq Group}}{\mbox{(Sum Sq Group + Sum Sq Residuals)}}$$


## How much variation is explained by group membership: $R^{2}$?

```{r}
anova(fm_lm)
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
anova(fm_lm)$`Sum Sq`[1]/sum(anova(fm_lm)$`Sum Sq`)

7.224492/(7.224492 + 9.415345)
```


## How much variation is explained by group membership: $R^{2}$?

```{r}
summary(fm_lm)
```


## Interactions



## Factorial data

Biomass gain in plants fertilized with either added nitrogen or phosphorous.

## Unbalanced interactions are complicated

ANOVA tables, sums of squares, and hypothesis tests are all impacted

- As soon as there are interactions with an unbalanced design, variables can share variance.


## Questions get complicated:

1. What is the effect of variable 1 on y, ignoring variable 2?
2. What is the effect of variable 2 on y, ignoring variable 1?
3. What is the effect of variable 1 on y, controlling for variable 2?
4. What is the effect of variable 2 on y, controlling for variable 1?


## Partitioning variance

Different ways to partition variance has a cascading effect:

- Determines sums of squares, which
- Determines mean squares, which
- Determines *P* values

Thus you should be aware of how your ANOVA table is calculated.


## Types of sums of squares

**Type I**: "sequential", "unweighted", ordering of factors in the model matters, the R default, probably **not** what you want *if you have unbalanced sample sizes*

**Type II**: main effects allowed to overlap with their interaction terms, useful if interaction is weak

**Type III**: "weighted", each reported effect controls for all the others (including interactions)


## Types of sums of squares

Each type tests subtly different hypotheses.

- Use Type I if you have balanced data
- Type I == Type III if the groups are balanced (ideal situation - you don't have to choose)
- Type III matches the output of `summary(lm())` (so that's nice)


** CHECKME**


## Unbalanced groups

Randomly drop 20 rows:

```{r}
#| echo: true

set.seed(15)
BM_ub <- BM |> slice_sample(prop = 0.75)
BM_ub |> count(Nitrogen, Phosphorous)
```


## ANOVA Model 1

```{r}
#| echo: true

fm1 <- lm(Biomass ~ Nitrogen * Phosphorous, data = BM_ub)
anova(fm1)
```


## ANOVA Model 2

```{r}
#| echo: true

fm2 <- lm(Biomass ~ Phosphorous * Nitrogen, data = BM_ub)
anova(fm2)
```


## Type III sums of squares

```{r}
#| echo: true

library(car)
Anova(fm1, type = "III")
```


## Type III sums of squares

```{r}
#| echo: true

Anova(fm2, type = "III")
```


## Key points

1. Check your sample sizes within groups
1. Pay attention when you have interaction terms
1. Think about your sums of squares
1. Type II or Type III is likely what you want


## Higher order interaction terms

It is difficult enough to interpret an interaction in a 2 X 2 ANOVA model.

- Higher order terms multiply and become virtually impossible to comprehend

$$Biomass = \beta_0 + ... + \beta_k (N \times P \times  K)$$

- What does a significant Nitrogen X Phosphorus X Potassium interaction mean?

Split your data and carry out two analyses unless you really must.


## I really want to know more about these Type III sums of squares

Check the Canvas resources.


## These disagreements are all specific to sums of squares and variance component estimation.
