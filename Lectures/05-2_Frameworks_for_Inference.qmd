## Models and Inference

- You want to use data to answer questions.
- Make *inferences* using *models* with data.

The method you use for inference is part of the model.

- Different sets of assumptions
- Many will give very similar answers



Notes: what do we assume when we use a method? how do we know what "the answer" is? how do we know how certain we are about the answer?

## Frameworks for Inference

1. Maximum likelihood/Frequentist
2. Bayesian 

Each is a different way to approach the question with different costs and benefits. One is not inherently better than the other.

## Maximum likelihood

For a given mean, how likely is observing my data?

- Maximum likelihood searches for the value of the mean (or other parameter of interest) that maximizes this likelihood.

Analytical solutions are generally equal to the maximum likelihood solutions (for set of assumptions).

## Analytical

Algebraic (closed form) solutions for estimating parameters

$$\bar{Y} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}Y_i}{n}$$

- Historically, calculations had to be made by hand
- We made and continue to make a lot of strong inference from these calculations
    - The first ~75-100 years of experimental life sciences

## Analytical

Like the slope in bivariate regression, many are based of sums of squares (summed squared deviations).

$$b = \frac{\sum\left(X_{i}-\bar{X}\right)\left(Y_{i}-\bar{Y}\right)}{\sum\left(X_{i}-\bar{X}\right)^{2}}$$

## Formulas can get unwieldy

## Bayesian

What is the probability of these parameter estimates given the data and my prior knowledge?

- Inferences from data conditioned on prior knowledge
- Prior knowledge may be strong or weak

$$Pr[\theta | Data] = \frac{Pr[Data | \theta] \times Pr[\theta]}{Pr[Data]}$$
