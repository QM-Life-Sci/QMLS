## Measures of central tendency (location)

The value around which the distribution is centered

1. Mean 
1. Median
1. Mode (most common value)


## Sample (arithmetic) mean

$$\bar{Y} = \frac{\sum^n_{i=1}Y_i}{n}$$

The term "mean" is preferred to "average". Most of the time they are synonymous. 


## Median

- The median is the central measurement of a sample (the 50th percentile and the 0.50 quantile).
- If $n$ is even, then the median is the mean of the two middle observations.

```{r}
#| echo: true

1:10
median(1:10)
quantile(1:10, prob = 0.5)
```


## Mean vs. Median

Number of lateral plates (plates) in threespine sticklebacks (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*) with three different *Ectodysplasin* genotypes (*mm*, *Mm*, and *MM*).

## Mean vs. Median

```{r}
SticklebackPlates <- read_csv("../data/Stickleback_Plates.csv",
                              show_col_types = FALSE)
```

```{r}
#| echo: true

glimpse(SticklebackPlates)
```


## Mean vs. Median

```{r}
ggplot(SticklebackPlates, aes(x = plates)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "gray75") +
  facet_grid(genotype ~ .) +
  labs(x = "Number of Lateral Body Plates", y = "Count") +
  theme(strip.text = element_text(face = "italic"))
```


## Mean vs. Median

```{r}
#| echo: true

SticklebackPlates |> 
  summarize(mean_plate = mean(plates),
            median_plate = median(plates),
            .by = genotype)
```


## Mean is sensitive to extreme values

```{r}
M <- SticklebackPlates |> 
  group_by(genotype) |> 
  summarize(Mean = mean(plates),
            Median = median(plates),
            .groups = "drop") |> 
  gather(Value, x, -genotype)

ggplot(SticklebackPlates, aes(x = plates, group = genotype)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "gray75") +
  geom_vline(data = M, aes(xintercept = x, color = Value),
             linewidth = 2) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("firebrick4", "navyblue")) +
  facet_grid(genotype ~ .) +
  labs(x = "Number of Lateral Body Plates", y = "Count") +
  theme(strip.text = element_text(face = "italic"))
```


## Mean, median, and mode

```{r}
set.seed(3246788)

mode <- function(x) {
  dd <- density(x)
  dd$x[which.max(dd$y)]
}

DD <- tibble(y = rnorm(500, 10, 1))
DD_mmm <- DD |> 
  summarize(Mean = mean(y),
            Median = median(y),
            Mode = mode(y)) |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = everything())

ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(data = DD, aes(y), bins = 30, fill = "gray75") +
  geom_vline(data = DD_mmm, aes(xintercept = value, color = name),
             linewidth = 2) +
  scale_color_manual(name = "Measure", values = c("firebrick4", "navyblue", "mediumorchid")) +
  labs(y = "Count")

```


## Mean, median, and mode

```{r}
set.seed(3246788)

DD <- tibble(y = c(rlnorm(250, 2, 1), runif(250, 50, 250)))
DD_mmm <- DD |> 
  summarize(Mean = mean(y),
            Median = median(y),
            Mode = mode(y)) |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = everything())

ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(data = DD, aes(y), bins = 30, fill = "gray75") +
  geom_vline(data = DD_mmm, aes(xintercept = value, color = name),
             linewidth = 2) +
  scale_color_manual(name = "Measure", values = c("firebrick4", "navyblue", "mediumorchid")) +
  labs(y = "Count")

```


## Outstanding questions

1. When might you substitute the median for the mean?
1. Why don't we always use the median?
1. When would you use the mode?



## Measures of spread

- A measure of how much variation is present in a distribution around its center
- How widely scattered the observations are


## Percentiles and quantiles

The $X$th **percentile** of a sample is the value below which $X\%$ of the observations lie. Percentiles are reported as percent.

 **Quantile** = Percentile / 100%. The range of quantiles is $0 \rightarrow 1$.

```{r}
#| echo: true

xx <- rnorm(100000)
quantile(xx, 0.84)
quantile(xx, 0.975)
```


## Quartiles and interquartile range

*Quartiles*

- Divide a set of data into quarters
- Minimum, maximum, 25th and 75th percentiles

*Interquartile range*

- Difference between the first and third quartiles


## Boxplots {.smaller}

Different variations, but the most standard recipe is:

1. Median = center line
2. Box = IQR (25th to 75th percentiles)
3. Whiskers at 1.5 X 25th and 75th percentiles
4. Dots for anything outside 1.5 X 25th and 75th percentiles

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 5, fig.align = 'center'}
ggplot(SticklebackPlates, aes(x = genotype, y = plates)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.3), alpha = 0.5)
```


## Deviates {.smaller}

Lots of statistics have their basis in the deviation of an observation from a mean.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 3

DD <- tibble(x = 1:4,
             y = c(4, -2, 2, -4))
ggplot() +
  theme_void() +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0, xend = 4.5, y = 0, yend = 0),
               linewidth = 1.5) +
  geom_segment(data = DD, aes(x = x, xend = x,
                              y = y, yend = 0),
               color = "firebrick4",
               linetype = "dotted",
               linewidth = 1) +
  geom_point(data = DD, aes(x, y), size = 4) +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 5, y = 0,
           label = "Mean",
           size = 6)
```

The $i$th deviate is the difference of that observation and the sample mean:
$$
\textrm{Deviate}_i = Y_i - \bar{Y}
$$
We would like to have a single number to summarize the deviates for a sample.


## Sum of squares

Deviates are most often squared and summed:

$$
SS = \sum \left(Y_i - \bar{Y}\right)^2
$$

1. Why squared?
1. What does the sum of squares represent?


## Mean deviates

This is why we don't use the mean absolute deviation:

</center>

Absolute value wouldn't capture the greater variability in the right image.


## Sample variance

Sum of squares standardized by the sample size minus one ($n - 1$):

$$
s^2 = \frac{\sum \left(Y_i - \bar{Y}\right)^2}{n - 1}
$$

- Mean squared deviation of the observations from the mean.
- Measures the dispersion of a distribution away from the sample mean.


## Sample standard deviation {.smaller}

$$
s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum \left(Y_i - \bar{Y}\right)^2}{n - 1}}
$$

- Square root of the sample variance.
- Think of $s$ as the "mean" for deviation.
- About 68% of the observations are $\pm 1$ standard deviation from the mean for a normal distribution.
- When sample size is not low, the sample variance ($s^2$) is an *unbiased estimator* of the population variance ($\sigma^2$), though the calculation is a little different (divide by $n$ rather than $n − 1$) See [explanation of $n$ vs. $n-1$](http://stats.stackexchange.com/q/3931/597) 


## Coefficient of variation

Coefficient of variation represents the standard deviation as a percentage of the mean. Elephant mass has an inherently higher standard deviation than mouse mass.

$$
CV = 100\% \times \frac{s}{\bar{Y}}
$$

- Can be used as a general indicator of the amount of variability in a sample.
- Can also be used to (cautiously) compare variables that are not measured in the same units (e.g., basal metabolic rate to ear area).


## Coefficient of variation

```{r}
#| echo: true


SticklebackPlates |>
  group_by(genotype) |>
  summarise(Mean = mean(plates),
            SD = sd(plates),
            CV = 100 * sd(plates) / mean(plates))

```


## Standard error of the sample mean {.smaller}

$$SE_{\bar{Y}} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$

Means are always reported with standard errors (or standard deviations).

- **Standard deviation** quantifies scatter — how much the values vary from one another and does not change predictably as you collect more data.
- **Standard error** of the mean quantifies how precisely you know the population mean. It takes into account both the value of $s$ and the sample size. Always decreases with larger sample size.


## Standard error of the sample mean

```{r}
#| echo: true

SEM <- function(x) {sd(x) / sqrt(length(x))}

SticklebackPlates |> 
  group_by(genotype) |> 
  summarise(SEM_plates = SEM(plates))

```


## Raw data with summary stats

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide 

ggplot(SticklebackPlates, aes(x = genotype, y = plates)) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.2, seed = 423479),
             alpha = 0.5) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", size = 3, color = "red") + 
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_se, geom = "errorbar", width = 0.1,
               color = "red", linewidth = 1)
```
