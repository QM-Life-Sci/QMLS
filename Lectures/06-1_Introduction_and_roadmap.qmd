- Probability $\rightarrow$ Likelihood
- Describing data (location and spread)
- Mean of a single sample


## Roadmap

*This unit*: Two fundamental analyses for a normally distributed outcome variable:

1. Bivariate regression (association of two variables)
1. Comparison of two group means

*Later units*: Gradually add complexity (more groups, additional predictors, different outcome distributions)


## Types of predictors

1. <span style="color:blue;">Categorical</span>
    - Groups
    - Genotypes
2. <span style="color:red;">Continuous</span>
    - Continuous number line
    - Rounding okay


## Example: Wing Dimorphic Crickets

> Do <span style="color:blue;">long-winged</span> crickets have a higher resting metabolic rate than <span style="color:blue;">short-winged</span> crickets?

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
Controlling for <span style="color:red;">body mass</span>,

- <span style="color:red;">Metabolic rates</span> do not differ
- Average metabolic rate of long-wings is higher
- Average metabolic rate of long-wings is lower

## Example: Genetics of Corn Oil Content

> Which set of <span style="color:blue;">loci</span> best predicts <span style="color:red;">oil content</span> in corn kernels?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](https://i.imgur.com/w6z5m2e.jpg){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Heritability of corn oil content is 0
- Different possible combinations of SNPs
- All additive
- Dominance
- Epistasis
- Structural variants

## Example: Species richness in Missouri lakes

> Does the <span style="color:red;">number</span> of phytoplankton species change with <span style="color:purple;">agricultural intensity</span> around lakes?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](https://i.imgur.com/GoOM9bb.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
- There is no relationship between species richness and agricultural intensity
- There is a positive relationship
- There is a negative relationship

## Linear models

- General term for a linear relationship between an outcome (observed) variable and one or more predictors
- A functional relationship + "noise"
- Most common type of statistical model

$$\mbox{Outcome variable} \sim \mbox{Predictor variable(s)} + \mbox{Error}$$


## Does "linear" mean a straight line?

- Yes and no, depending on the context
    - Straight line $y \sim x$ relationships
- $x$ is continuous
    - "Straight" line $y \sim x$ relationships
- $x$ is categorical
- Polynomials ($x^2$, $x^3$, etc.): think of these as transformations


## Mathematical similarities among linear models

- Continuous and categorical predictors are *not different* mathematically
    - Categorical variables internally converted to 0 or 1 (details to come)

All linear models answer the same question:

> "How much does the outcome variable change (positive or negative) for each 1 unit increase in the predictor?"


## What we want to avoid

## What we want to encourage

- Data exploration through visualization
- Development of appropriate *models*
- Fit and compare models
- Make inferences

## Reframe traditional "named" tests

Useful for communication but mathematically just linear models

  - *t*-test, OLS regression, ANOVA, ANCOVA
  - Multiple regression

. . .

Linear models with some combination of predictors

  - Categorical or continuous?
  - How many of each?


## Roadmap

*This unit*: Two fundamental **linear models** for a normally distributed outcome variable:

1. Bivariate regression (association of two variables)
1. Comparison of two means

*Later units*: Gradually add complexity (more groups, additional predictors, different outcome distributions)


## Frameworks reminder

Regardless of the framework:

- Likelihood / frequentist
- Bayesian

The linear model relates the outcome variable to one or more predictors
