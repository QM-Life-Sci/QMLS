- Probability $\rightarrow$ Likelihood
- Describing data (location and spread)
- Means of a single sample


## Roadmap

*This unit*: Two fundamental analyses for a normally distributed outcome variable:

1. Comparison of two means
1. Bivariate regression (association of two variables)

*Later units*: Gradually add complexity (more groups, additional predictors, different outcome distributions)


## Types of predictors

1. <span style="color:blue;">Categorical</span>
    - Groups
    - Genotypes
2. <span style="color:red;">Continuous</span>
    - Continuous number line
    - Rounding okay


## Example: Wing Dimorphic Crickets

> Do <span style="color:blue;">long-winged</span> crickets have a higher resting metabolic rate than <span style="color:blue;">short-winged</span> crickets?

::: {.column width="40%"}

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
Controlling for <span style="color:red;">body mass</span>,

- <span style="color:red;">Metabolic rates</span> do not differ
- Average metabolic rate of long-wings is higher
- Average metabolic rate of long-wings is lower

## Example: Genetics of Corn Oil Content

> Which set of <span style="color:blue;">loci</span> best predicts <span style="color:red;">oil content</span> in corn kernels?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](https://i.imgur.com/w6z5m2e.jpg){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Heritability of corn oil content is 0
- Different possible combinations of SNPs
- All additive
- Dominance
- Epistasis
- Structural variants

## Example: Species richness in Missouri lakes

> Does the <span style="color:red;">number</span> of phytoplankton species change with <span style="color:purple;">agricultural intensity</span> around lakes?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](https://i.imgur.com/GoOM9bb.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
- There is no relationship between species richness and agricultural intensity
- There is a positive relationship
- There is a negative relationship

## Linear models

- General term for a linear relationship between an outcome (observed) variable and one or more predictors
- A functional relationship + "noise"
- Most common type of statistical model


## Does "linear" mean a straight line?

- Yes and no, depending on the context
    - Straight line $Y \sim X$ relationships
- $X$ is continuous
    - "Straight" line $Y \sim X$ relationships
- $X$ is categorical
- Polynomials ($X^2$, $X^3$, etc.)


## Non-linear models

- Does $e^X$ appear as one of the predictors? (e.g., growth)
- Are there ratios of predictors? (e.g., enzyme kinetics)

```{r}
set.seed(238746)
DD <- tibble(Age = seq(0, 20, length.out = 25),
             Length = 30 + 140 / (1 + exp(-0.65 * (Age - 10)))) |> 
  mutate(Length = Length + rnorm(n(), 0, 2))
ggplot(DD, aes(Age, Length)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 170, color = "darkred", linewidth = 1) +
  geom_point() +
  annotate(
    geom = "text",
    x = 5, y = 150,
    label = TeX("$Length(Age) = \\frac{Length_{final}}{1 + e^{-b~(Age - c)}}$",
                output = "character"),
    parse = TRUE,
    size = 7)
```


## Mathematical similarities among linear models

- Continuous and categorical predictors are not different mathematically
    - Categorical variables internally converted to 0 or 1

All answer the same question:

> "How much does the outcome variable change (positive or negative) for each 1 unit increase in the predictor?"


## Roadmap

*This unit*: Two fundamental **linear models** for a normally distributed outcome variable:

1. Comparison of two means
1. Bivariate regression (association of two variables)

*Later units*: Gradually add complexity (more groups, additional predictors, different outcome distributions)


## Reframe traditional "named" tests

Useful for communication but mathematically just variations of a theme

  - *t*-test, OLS regression, ANOVA, ANCOVA
  - Multiple regression

. . .

Linear models with some combination of predictors

  - Categorical or continuous?
  - How many of each?


## Diagnostics and assumptions - intro



## Estimation, hypothesis testing, questions - show how they are the same


## Frameworks reminder
