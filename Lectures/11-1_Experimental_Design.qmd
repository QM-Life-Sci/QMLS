## Why you should care about experimental design

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| echo: false

library(tidyverse)
library(cowplot)
library(GGally)
library(readxl)
theme_set(theme_cowplot())

## Experimental Design Issues for Data Analysis

- Challenges and limits of what we can learn from life sciences data
- Repeatability
    - How much error do we expect in our measurements?
- Designing experiments to minimize decision errors/mistakes
    - Mistake 1: Predictor(s) is important when it really isn't
    - Mistake 2: Predictor(s) is not important when it really is


## Do these first: 

- Define (and write down) your main question
    - What do I want to learn?
- Define useful models

Key questions to ask at every step:

1. **What question am I trying to answer?**
1. **What processes could have produced the pattern I am observing?**


## Planning

- What data will I collect?
- How will I analyze the data?
    - What questions can and cannot be answered by my dataset? Consider all the possibilities.

What other data can I collect at the same time that might be useful at some unknown time in the future?


## Critical issues in the life sciences

1. Random variation
    - Why do we need replication?
1. Confounding factors
    - Complexity and interdependence is a feature of most life sciences systems


## Random variation (a.k.a., sampling error)

**What processes could have produced the pattern I am observing?**

![](../images/fish_sample.jpg){fig-align="center" width="100%"}
- Replication allows you to partition random variation and variation attributable to a predictor of interest


## Replication

**Replication is needed to estimate variation within a group.**

- Replicates must be independent. Think about:
    - Common field environments, shared enclosures
    - Observations made in batches (days, months, years)
    - Repeated measures of a single individual
    - Measurements of genetically related units or related species

Many issues can be addressed statistically if you use an appropriate model.


## What level needs replication?

**What question am I trying to answer?**

- You cannot infer causation if you have not do not have **independent** replicates of the potential causal factor.


## Pseudoreplication

Leaf area at one high rainfall and one low rainfall site (10 plots per site)

## Pseudoreplication

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}

```{r}
set.seed(6239)
LA <- tibble("LeafArea"= c(rnorm(10,4,1),rnorm(10,7,1)),
             "Rainfall" = rep(c("Low","High"),each=10))

ggplot(LA, aes(Rainfall, LeafArea)) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.05), alpha = 0.5, size = 5) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", size = 5, color = "red") +
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_se, geom = "errorbar", width = 0.1,
               color = "red", size = 2) +
  labs(x = "Rainfall", y = "Leaf Area") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20))

```

What else might differ between these two individual sites besides rainfall?

::::


## Pseudoreplication

- Any two groups are expected to differ for any number of reasons.
    - Replication within these groups will just reveal this difference, not show causality
- You need replication at the level of your variable of interest 


## Random sampling and confounding factors

Independence is a critical assumption in (nearly) all your analyses

- Non-random sampling precludes independence

Can we really expect samples to be completely independent?

- Museum specimens
- Fossil record

**What processes could have produced the pattern I am observing?**


## Confounding factors

Marmots across altitudes & temperatures

```{r}
set.seed(188)

tt <- signif(runif(30, 8, 28), digits = 3)
aa <- round(-500 * tt + rnorm(30, 17000, 500))

mm <- signif(-1.5 * tt + 0.001 * aa + 150 + rnorm(30, 0, 6))

MM <- data.frame("MarmotID" = paste0("M", seq(1, 30)),
                 "Altitude" = aa, 
                 "Temperature" = tt, 
                 "MetabolicRate" = mm)

ggscatmat(MM, columns = 2:4)

```


## Examples

- Define (and write down) your main question
    - What do I want to learn?
- Define useful models

Key questions to ask at every step:

1. **What question am I trying to answer?**
1. **What processes could have produced the pattern I am observing?**


## Example: Wing Dimorphic Crickets

> Do long-winged crickets have a higher resting metabolic rate than short-winged crickets?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
Controlling for body mass,

- Metabolic rates do not differ
- Average metabolic rate of long-wings is higher
- Average  metabolic rate of long-wings is lower
