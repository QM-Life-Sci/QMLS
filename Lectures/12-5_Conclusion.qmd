## Topics we have covered

- Programming with data, reproducible research
- Data wrangling and visualization
- Probability and likelihood
- Lots of linear models, some multilevel
- Making decisions, making errors in decisions
- Model comparison
- Experimental design


## Techniques for using what you have learned

- Start simple
- Recognize problems you have seen before
- Adapt code for your own use
    - View this course as a set of recipes


## Non-exhaustive list of topics we have not covered

- Randomization and simulation
- Multivariate approaches
- Non-linear models
- (Most of) Bayesian inference
- (Most of) multilevel models
- Non-Gaussian outcome variables


## Where to go from here

- Quantitative Methods in Life Sciences 2 (BIO_SC 8642)
    - 5 week modules on focused topics
- Other formal or informal classes (MU, online)
- Study groups (pick a book and work through)
- Discussion groups (Dataphiles, R-MUsers slack)
- Self-study
